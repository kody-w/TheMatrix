## Why These 5?

| What | Demo 1 | Demo 2 | Demo 3 | Demo 4 | Demo 5 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Concept** | 6-step workflow | Pattern extraction | Business value | Non-code domain | Design at scale |
| **Score** | 46/50 | 46/50 | 43/50 | 41/50 | 37/50 |
| **Domain** | Software | Software | Business | Data | Design |
| **N×M** | 10×350 files | 10×250 files | 10×30 processes | 10×20 datasets | 10×20 assets |
| **Impact** | "3,500 hrs saved" | "Pattern × 2,500" | "$200k value" | "200 insights" | "100% consistency" |

---

## The Learning Journey

1. **Demo 1 (Docs Engine)**: "How does The Matrix work?"
2. **Demo 2 (Migration)**: "How does pattern extraction work?"
3. **Demo 3 (Automation)**: "What's the business value?"
4. **Demo 4 (Data)**: "Does it work for other domains?"
5. **Demo 5 (Brand)**: "How do I enforce consistency?"

**Result**: Visitor can apply orchestration to their own work.

## Demo Visualization Pattern (All Follow This)

```
TOP: Orchestrator status ("Analyzing files...")
MIDDLE: 10 agent progress bars (showing parallel work)
BOTTOM: Outcomes emerging + metrics (showing results)
SIDE: Learning sidebar (explaining what you're seeing)
```

## Success Criteria

Visitors leave understanding:

1. **Parallel Execution** - Why 10 agents beat 1
2. **N×M Structure** - How to break work into packages
3. **Pattern Extraction** - Why finding patterns matters
4. **Domain Versatility** - Orchestration applies everywhere
5. **Business Value** - The quantifiable ROI

---

## Why Educational-First?

Not building 10 wow-factor demos.
Building 5 teaching demos.

Visitors don't just think "cool"—they understand how to use it.

---

## Implementation Time

- **Demo 1**: 3 hours
- **Demo 2**: 3 hours
- **Demos 3-5**: 3 hours each (9 hours total)
- **Cathedral Integration**: 3 hours
- **Total**: ~18 hours

---

## Key Insight

**The cathedral succeeds not by impressing viewers, but by teaching them.**

Each demo answers a question:
- "How does it work?" (Demo 1)
- "Why is pattern extraction important?" (Demo 2)
- "What's the ROI?" (Demo 3)
- "Does it apply beyond code?" (Demos 4-5)

Visitors leave knowing not just what The Matrix does, but how to build orchestrations.

---

## Recommendation

**Build all 5 core demos.** They represent:
- 2 foundation concepts (workflow, patterns)
- 3 domain variety (business, data, design)

Together = comprehensive introduction to orchestration thinking.
