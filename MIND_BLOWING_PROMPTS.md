## The 10 Prompts

### 1. 🏗️ The Great Migration
```
Migrate my entire legacy monolith (2,500 files, 500K lines) to microservices architecture with full test coverage, documentation, and deployment configs
```
**Output:** 50 microservices + 200 APIs + 500 tests + 150 docs + 50 K8s configs
**Timeline:** 6-12 months → **2-3 hours**

---

### 2. 🧠 The Knowledge Synthesizer
```
Analyze the top 75 AI research papers from 2024, extract key innovations, synthesize into 200 blog articles for different audiences (technical, business, general public), with interactive demos for each concept
```
**Output:** 200+ articles + 50 interactive demos
**Value:** Complete AI knowledge hub from research to education

---

### 3. 🚀 The Complete Product Launch
```
I have a rough idea for a SaaS product. Generate: market analysis, competitive research, full technical architecture, working MVP (frontend + backend + database), marketing website, 50 blog posts, email sequences, social media content calendar (3 months), pitch deck, and financial projections
```
**Output:** Everything from idea → launch
**Impact:** Compress months of startup work into hours

---

### 4. 📚 The Documentation Engine
```
My codebase has 3,500 files with zero documentation. Generate: comprehensive README, architecture diagrams, API docs, user guides, onboarding tutorials, troubleshooting guides, contribution guidelines, and interactive code explorer
```
**Output:** 400+ doc pages + 50 diagrams + 20 tutorials
**Value:** Enterprise-grade documentation from zero

---

### 5. 🌍 The Parallel Universe Builder
```
Create a complete fantasy universe: 100 unique locations, 200 characters with backstories, 50 magic systems, 30 historical events, 25 languages/dialects, 40 cultural traditions, political systems, economies, and 100 illustrated scenes
```
**Output:** 600+ interconnected elements with perfect consistency
**Creativity:** World-building in hours vs years

---

### 6. ✅ The Test Suite Generator
```
I have a legacy app with 80% code coverage gap. Generate comprehensive test suites: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, performance tests, security tests, accessibility tests, and chaos engineering scenarios. Include test data generators and CI/CD integration
```
**Output:** 5,000+ tests + 100 data generators + 20 CI/CD configs
**Quality:** Industrial-scale test automation

---

### 7. 🔍 The Competitive Intelligence System
```
Monitor my top 50 competitors: scrape their websites, analyze their products, track pricing changes, summarize their blog posts, analyze their job postings for strategy signals, generate weekly competitive intelligence reports, and identify market opportunities
```
**Output:** Real-time competitive intelligence dashboard
**Value:** Business intelligence automation at scale

---

### 8. 🌐 The Localization Machine
```
Localize my app for 30 languages: translate all UI strings, adapt content for cultural context, generate locale-specific examples, create 30 localized marketing sites, 30 help centers, and 30 sets of app store materials
```
**Output:** 30 fully localized product experiences
**Impact:** Global expansion (normally takes years) in hours

---

### 9. ⚡ The Code Migration Gauntlet
```
Migrate my Python 2 Django app to: Python 3, FastAPI, Next.js frontend, GraphQL API, PostgreSQL → MongoDB, Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, TypeScript typing throughout, and modern CI/CD. Maintain feature parity and add comprehensive tests
```
**Output:** Complete stack modernization
**Complexity:** 8 parallel technology migrations simultaneously

---

### 10. 🎨 The Meta-Framework Generator
```
Analyze the patterns in my last 10 projects. Extract common architectural decisions, create a custom framework/boilerplate that captures my team's best practices, generate comprehensive docs, example projects, migration guides from our old stack, and VS Code extension for our conventions
```
**Output:** Custom framework + 100+ docs + 20 examples + VS Code extension
**Value:** Codifies years of institutional knowledge
