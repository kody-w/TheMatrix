## The Recommendation: 5 Core Demos

### TIER 1: Foundation (Build First)

**1. Documentation Engine (3,500 → 400 docs) - Score: 46/50**
- Teaches: The complete 6-step orchestration workflow
- Why: Shows full pipeline end-to-end
- Key Metric: "3,500 hours of work = 35 days parallel"

**2. The Great Migration (2,500 → React) - Score: 46/50**
- Teaches: Pattern extraction and consistent application
- Why: Solidifies pattern thinking as core skill
- Key Metric: "One pattern × 2,500 files = complete refactoring"

### TIER 2: Domain Variety (Choose 2-3)

**3. Automation Orchestrator (50 → 300 workflows) - Score: 43/50**
- Teaches: Business value and ROI
- Why: Shows orchestration has tangible business impact
- Key Metric: "2,000 hours saved = $200k value"

**4. Data Storyteller (Raw data → 200 insights) - Score: 41/50**
- Teaches: Orchestration works for non-code domains
- Why: Proves universal applicability
- Key Metric: "200 insights from one dataset"

**5. Brand Metamorphosis (200+ assets) - Score: 37/50**
- Teaches: Design systems and consistency at scale
- Why: Demonstrates creative domain orchestration
- Key Metric: "100% consistency without manual review"

## Why This Selection

| Criteria | Documentation | Migration | Automation | Data | Brand |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Educational Value** | 46/50 | 46/50 | 43/50 | 41/50 | 37/50 |
| **Teaches What** | Full workflow | Pattern extraction | ROI | Versatility | Consistency |
| **Domain** | Code | Code | Business | Data | Design |
| **N×M** | 10×350 | 10×250 | 10×30 | 10×20 | 10×20 |
| **Difficulty** | Easy | Easy | Medium | Medium | Medium |

**Why not the others?**
- Universe Architect: Too abstract, unclear what's orchestrated
- Curriculum Architect: Too many artifact types, confusing
- System Designer: Not naturally parallel, doesn't show agents
- Knowledge Synthesizer: Included as optional Demo 6
- Platform Alchemist: Included as optional Demo 7

---

## The Learning Journey

Visitors progress through increasing understanding:

1. **Demo 1: Documentation Engine**
   - "I understand the 6-step workflow"

2. **Demo 2: The Great Migration**
   - "I understand pattern extraction"

3. **Demo 3: Automation Orchestrator**
   - "I understand the business value"

4. **Demo 4: Data Storyteller**
   - "I understand orchestration applies everywhere"

5. **Demo 5: Brand Metamorphosis**
   - "I understand consistency at scale"

**Result**: Visitors can apply orchestration to their own work.

---

## The 5 Core Concepts

Every visitor should leave understanding:

1. **Parallel Execution** - "Why 10 agents beats 1"
2. **N×M Structure** - "How to break work into packages"
3. **Pattern Extraction** - "Why finding patterns matters"
4. **Domain Versatility** - "Orchestration applies everywhere"
5. **Business Value** - "What's the quantifiable ROI?"

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1: Foundation (3 hours each)**
- Documentation Engine
- Great Migration

**Phase 2: Domain Variety (3 hours each)**
- Automation Orchestrator
- Data Storyteller
- Brand Metamorphosis

**Phase 3: Integration (3 hours)**

---

## Key Insight

This is an **educational-first strategy**, not a wow-factor strategy.

**Why?**
- 5 focused teaching demos > 10 scattered amazing demos
- Visitors understand, not just impressed
- Visitors can apply orchestration to their work
- Cathedral becomes a learning tool, not just a showcase

---

## Success Criteria

The cathedral succeeds when visitors can answer:

1. **"What does orchestration do?"** ← Should answer clearly after Demo 1
2. **"Why is pattern extraction important?"** ← Should answer after Demo 2
3. **"What's the business value?"** ← Should answer after Demo 3
4. **"Does this apply to my domain?"** ← Should answer after Demos 4-5
5. **"How would I build my own orchestration?"** ← Should be able to explain

---

## Optional Advanced Demos (if resources allow)

### Demo 6: Knowledge Synthesizer (75 → 200) - Score: 38/50
- Teaches: Information synthesis and expansion
- Concept: "N inputs become many outputs"

### Demo 7: Platform Alchemist (1 → 500) - Score: 37/50
- Teaches: Atomic decomposition and networks
- Concept: "1 book becomes 500 interconnected pieces"
