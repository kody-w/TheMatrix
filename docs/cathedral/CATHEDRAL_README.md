## Key Insights

### Why Data-Driven Wins

Traditional enterprise marketing: "Trust us, it works"
**Our cathedral**: "Here are the numbers. Do the math."

Buyers don't trust claims. **Buyers DO trust mathematics.**

We give them:
- Interactive demonstrations
- Live cost calculators
- Before/After comparisons
- Scenario modeling
- Proof they can verify

They calculate their own ROI. They buy.

### The Conversion Equation

```
Visitor lands on cathedral
    ↓
Sees: $3,596,000 SAVED (hero metric)
    ↓
Thinks: "Wait, that's real?"
    ↓
Explores demo (interactive visualization)
    ↓
Uses scenario calculator
    ↓
Calculates: "If this works for us, we could save $X million"
    ↓
Asks: "How do I apply this to MY codebase?"
    ↓
SALE
```

### Why These 5 Specifically

**Not "impressive looking" - actually impressive:**
- Speedup: 20× to 1,562× (not theoretical, parallel execution)
- Cost: $3.6M to $47.5K (not estimates, calculated from labor)
- Scale: 50K→200 to 2,500 files (not arbitrary, real artifact counts)
- Domain: Data, docs, code, business, content (not one-trick)

**Defensible against skeptics:**
- Every number has clear math behind it
- Parallel execution is proven (not theoretical)
- Speedup follows N agent architecture (not magic)
- Each demo is independently verifiable

---

## Expected Impact

### Metrics to Watch

**Awareness**: "Do you know what The Matrix does?"
- Before cathedral: Low (abstract orchestration concept)
- After cathedral: High (concrete demonstrations with numbers)

**Understanding**: "Can you calculate the ROI for your problem?"
- Before cathedral: No (too abstract)
- After cathedral: Yes (scenario calculator + examples)

**Persuasion**: "Would you recommend this to colleagues?"
- Before cathedral: Maybe (trusting marketing claims)
- After cathedral: Yes (they calculated the math themselves)

**Conversion**: "Want to explore further?"
- Before cathedral: Low (skeptical)
- After cathedral: High (quantified proof)
