# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is **The Matrix** - a generalized AI orchestration framework built on Claude Code's hierarchical agent architecture. The system demonstrates context-aware orchestration where a 200k context orchestrator (you) manages parallel execution of specialized agents to produce any outcome at scale.

## Architecture

### Core Orchestration Pattern

The system follows a **hierarchical agent architecture** applicable to any domain:

```
Orchestrator (200k context - You)
├── Discovery & Analysis (reads project context)
├── Strategy Generation (creates work breakdown structure)
├── System Analysis (extracts patterns, standards, schemas)
└── Parallel Agent Spawning
    ├── N × outcome-generator agents (parallel execution)
    └── 1 × integrator agent (synthesizes results)
```

**Key Principle**: The orchestrator (main Claude instance) preserves its 200k context for coordination by delegating all implementation work to subagents, each with their own clean 200k context window.

### Agent System

Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/` with YAML frontmatter:

**Available Agents:**

1. **outcome-generator** - Produces outcome artifacts according to specification
   - Tools: Read, Write, Bash, Task
   - Model: haiku
   - Usage: Spawn N in parallel for N×M total outcomes
   - Configurable for any domain: code generation, content creation, test suites, data pipelines, documentation, etc.

2. **integrator** - Synthesizes and integrates all generated outcomes
   - Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
   - Model: haiku
   - Usage: Invoke once after all outcome-generator agents complete
   - Handles: Navigation, routing, aggregation, validation, system integration

### MCP Configuration

The `.mcp.json` file configures Model Context Protocol servers:
- **playwright**: Browser automation for testing generated outcomes (when applicable)
- Extensible: Add domain-specific MCP servers as needed

## Primary Workflow: Parallel Outcome Generation

When a user requests any large-scale outcome generation, follow the domain-agnostic 6-step workflow:

### Step 1: Discovery & Analysis (Orchestrator)
- Scan relevant project documentation and source files
- Extract domain context: business model, technical stack, standards, patterns
- Analyze existing systems (design systems, code patterns, data schemas)
- Identify constraints and requirements

### Step 2: Generate Work Breakdown Structure (Orchestrator)
- Create high-level work packages from domain analysis
- Generate specific work items per package
- Align with project requirements and standards
- Example: 10 packages × 5 items = 50 total outcomes

### Step 3: Prepare Agent Briefing (Orchestrator)
- Document project summary, technical standards, domain patterns
- Create comprehensive brief for agents
- Include schemas, templates, and success criteria

### Step 4: Spawn N Agents in Parallel (Critical)
Use the Task tool to spawn all outcome-generator agents simultaneously:
- All agents invoked in a single message with N Task tool calls
- Each agent receives M work items for one package
- Each agent gets complete context and specifications

**IMPORTANT**: Sequential spawning defeats the parallel execution design. Must spawn all agents at once.

### Step 5: Integrate & Synthesize Results
Use the Task tool to invoke the integrator agent:
- Pass all N×M generated outcomes
- Provide work breakdown structure
- Include integration requirements

### Step 6: Collect & Report Results
- Aggregate all generated outcomes
- Validate against success criteria
- Store metadata (if tracking system configured)
- Report completion with full details

## Context Preservation Strategy

**Critical Rule**: Use subagents for ALL implementation work to preserve orchestrator context.

### When to Use Subagents

**Always delegate to subagents:**
- Code generation
- File creation/editing (beyond simple config updates)
- Content writing (documentation, articles, pages)
- Complex multi-step implementations
- Data processing and transformation
- Test suite generation

**Keep in orchestrator context:**
- Reading documentation for discovery
- Strategic planning and decision-making
- Agent coordination and result aggregation
- High-level analysis and reporting

### Example: Correct Context Usage

**Wrong approach:**
```
User: "Generate 50 [outcomes]"
Orchestrator: [Reads docs] → [Generates strategy] → [Writes outcome 1] → [Writes outcome 2]...
Problem: Context consumed by implementation, can't coordinate multiple agents
```

**Correct approach:**
```
User: "Generate 50 [outcomes]"
Orchestrator: [Reads docs] → [Generates strategy] → [Spawns N agents in parallel]
Agents: [Each generates M outcomes independently]
Orchestrator: [Aggregates results] → [Reports completion]
Benefit: 200k context available for coordination, N× faster execution
```

## Use Cases & Domains

The Matrix architecture supports any domain requiring parallel generation:

### Software Development
- **Feature Generation**: N agents × M components = complete feature set
- **Test Suite Generation**: N test suites × M test cases = comprehensive coverage
- **API Endpoint Generation**: N services × M endpoints = complete API
- **Documentation Generation**: N sections × M pages = full documentation

### Content Creation
- **Landing Pages**: N topics × M pages = content hub
- **Blog Articles**: N categories × M articles = content library
- **Marketing Assets**: N campaigns × M assets = marketing suite
- **Technical Guides**: N products × M guides = knowledge base

### Data Engineering
- **Data Pipelines**: N sources × M transformations = complete ETL
- **Schema Generation**: N domains × M tables = data warehouse
- **Migration Scripts**: N systems × M migrations = full migration
- **Data Validation**: N datasets × M validators = quality assurance

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **IaC Modules**: N services × M resources = infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: N projects × M stages = deployment automation
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: N systems × M metrics = observability
- **Configuration Management**: N environments × M configs = infrastructure as code

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Parallel Agent Execution
Always spawn multiple agents simultaneously when possible. The Task tool supports multiple invocations in a single message for true parallel execution.

### 2. Stateless Agents
Each agent operates independently with its own context. Agents cannot communicate with each other or the orchestrator during execution. All necessary information must be provided in the initial briefing.

### 3. System Analysis & Pattern Discovery
Before spawning agents, always:
- Identify relevant frameworks and standards
- Extract patterns and conventions
- Document technical requirements
- Map dependencies and relationships
- Note constraints and success criteria

### 4. Metadata & Tracking
If a tracking system is detected:
- Extract schema for outcome metadata storage
- Pass tracking info to all outcome-generator agents
- Agents store metadata with context: package, item, outcome_id, status, metrics
- Orchestrator aggregates and verifies metadata post-generation

## Common Commands

This is a Claude Code orchestration framework, not a traditional codebase. There are no build, test, or run commands. The system executes through Claude Code agent invocation.

**To use the framework:**
```bash
# Navigate to your target project directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Copy this repository's .claude directory
cp -r /path/to/TheMatrix/.claude .

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Request outcome generation (domain-specific)
"Generate 50 [landing pages / API endpoints / test cases / data pipelines / etc] for my project"
```

## Critical Success Criteria

When executing any orchestration workflow, verify:

- ✅ Comprehensive discovery completed (relevant files read and analyzed)
- ✅ Work breakdown structure generated from actual project analysis
- ✅ Work packages and items clearly documented
- ✅ System patterns and standards fully extracted and documented
- ✅ All N outcome-generator agents spawned simultaneously (not sequentially)
- ✅ All outcomes generated successfully
- ✅ Metadata stored in tracking system (if applicable)
- ✅ Integration and synthesis complete
- ✅ Complete documentation of work breakdown delivered

## Error Prevention

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

1. **Sequential Agent Spawning**: Never spawn agents one at a time. Always spawn all N outcome-generator agents in a single message with multiple Task invocations.

2. **Insufficient Discovery**: Don't generate strategy without reading relevant project files. Generic strategies fail because they don't align with actual requirements.

3. **Missing System Analysis**: Don't spawn agents without complete system/pattern analysis. Outcomes will lack consistency.

4. **Orchestrator Implementation**: Don't write code/content in the orchestrator context. Always delegate to subagents.

5. **Ignoring Metadata**: If a tracking system is detected, metadata must be stored. Don't skip this step.

## Development Philosophy

This framework demonstrates **context-aware AI orchestration** applicable to any domain:
- Orchestrator maintains strategic context (200k tokens)
- Agents execute tactical implementation (clean 200k contexts each)
- Parallel execution maximizes throughput
- Specialized agents maintain quality and consistency
- Domain-agnostic design enables universal application

Future Claude instances should follow this pattern: **orchestrate, don't implement**.
