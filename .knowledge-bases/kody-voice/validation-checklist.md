# Ghostwriter Content Validation Checklist

**Purpose**: Ensure generated content matches Kody's authentic voice before delivery
**Threshold**: Must check 12+ boxes across all 4 categories for 85%+ authenticity score

---

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Generate content** using ghostwriter-kody agent
2. **Read through** the generated piece
3. **Check boxes** for each element present
4. **Count total** checkboxes across all 4 categories
5. **Pass/Fail**: ≥12 boxes = PASS (ready for Kody's review), <12 boxes = FAIL (needs revision)

---

## Category 1: Structural Markers
**Requirement**: 3+ boxes checked

- [ ] **Opening Hook**: Starts with concrete scenario OR relatable question OR declarative statement
  - Examples: "Woke up to 12,625 emails...", "Have you noticed...", "This is not theoretical."

- [ ] **Sentence Rhythm**: Uses short declarative sentences (8-12 words) mixed with longer explanatory passages (30-45 words)
  - Example: "Think about it like The Beatles." [short] "Individually talented, but together? Magic—each member bringing unique strengths..." [long]

- [ ] **Scannable Headers**: Includes clear hierarchical structure (##, ###) that enables scanning
  - Readers should understand 80% of content from headers alone

- [ ] **Framework Structure**: Has bullet lists or numbered frameworks for key concepts
  - Breaking down complex ideas into digestible components

- [ ] **Open-Ended Conclusion**: Ends with invitation or "..." suggesting ongoing exploration
  - Not closed completion, but opening for participation

**Category 1 Score**: ___/5 (need 3+)

---

## Category 2: Vocabulary Match
**Requirement**: 4+ boxes checked

- [ ] **Core Technical Terms**: Uses Kody's signature vocabulary
  - orchestrate, spawn, synthesize, integrate, aggregate, autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, context window, parallel execution, conductor architecture

- [ ] **Business Framing Language**: Bridges technical ↔ business
  - portfolio, showcase, demonstrate capability, demand-driven, transparent, documented, audit trail, metadata

- [ ] **Action Verb Ratio**: Features strong action verbs (70/30 active/passive ratio)
  - transform, execute, implement, bridge, spawn, orchestrate, validate (not "is being done", "could be considered")

- [ ] **Memorable Framework Name**: Introduces neologism or memorable framework
  - Examples: "Prompt Transplantation", "Agent Storytelling", "Demand-Driven Development", "Conductor Architecture"

- [ ] **Universal Metaphor**: Uses accessible analogy to ground abstract concepts
  - Beatles/orchestra for collaboration, conductor for orchestration, spatial/visual metaphors

- [ ] **NO Hedging Language**: Avoids qualifying uncertainty
  - ❌ "might", "could", "possibly", "perhaps", "may"
  - ✅ "This is", "This works", "This transforms"

**Category 2 Score**: ___/6 (need 4+)

---

## Category 3: Tone Signals
**Requirement**: 3+ boxes checked

- [ ] **Confident Declarative Statements**: Makes bold claims without excessive qualification
  - "This is not theoretical. This is immediate action."
  - "The Conductor Architecture transforms how agents collaborate."

- [ ] **First-Person Casual Narration**: Uses conversational, personal voice
  - "Let me tell you about...", "Have you noticed...", "The old me would've..."

- [ ] **Self-Aware Vulnerability**: Includes authentic personal story or confession
  - "gave up and let entropy win", "would've spent weeks procrastinating"

- [ ] **Technical ↔ Business Bridge**: Successfully makes complex concepts accessible without dumbing down
  - Assumes intelligence, explains paradigms not basics, maintains credibility

- [ ] **Optimistic About Technology**: Forward-looking, enthusiastic about potential
  - Not cynical, not overhyped—balanced optimism grounded in practical results

**Category 3 Score**: ___/5 (need 3+)

---

## Category 4: Content Logic
**Requirement**: 3+ boxes checked

- [ ] **Example-Heavy**: Leads with concrete scenarios before abstract concepts
  - "12,625 emails transformed overnight" before explaining Prompt Transplantation
  - Real results before theoretical benefits

- [ ] **Explains "Why" Before "How"**: Establishes motivation and context before implementation
  - Why this matters → What's possible → How the framework works

- [ ] **Scaffolding Progression**: Uses three-level framework structure
  - Level 1: Traditional approach (and limitations)
  - Level 2: Advanced/template solutions (better but incomplete)
  - Level 3: Kody's breakthrough approach (the new paradigm)

- [ ] **Outcome-Focused**: Emphasizes results and impact over process
  - Quantified outcomes (specific numbers, deliverables)
  - Transformation narratives (before → after)

- [ ] **Reader as Participant**: Positions reader as active participant, not passive observer
  - "You are The Beatles", invitations to explore, open-ended questions

**Category 4 Score**: ___/5 (need 3+)

4. ✅ Await feedback for continuous improvement

### If FAIL (<12 boxes):
1. ❌ Identify failing categories
2. ❌ Apply revision guide
3. ❌ Regenerate content

## Feedback Integration

After Kody reviews and edits:

1. **Compare Original vs Final**: Note all changes made
2. **Categorize Edits**: Structural / Vocabulary / Tone / Content Logic
3. **Extract Patterns**: What types of edits recur?
4. **Update Voice Analysis**: Add successful patterns to voice-analysis.md
5. **Improve Checklist**: Add new validation criteria if needed
6. **Track Metrics**: Record authenticity score, edit count, time to publish

**Goal**: Each feedback cycle improves future generations, reducing edit count over time.
