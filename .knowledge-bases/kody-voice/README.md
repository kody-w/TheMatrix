## How to Use This Knowledge Base

### For the Ghostwriter Agent

**Before writing ANY content**, read:
1. `voice-analysis.md` - Essential patterns, linguistic DNA, quality checklist
2. 2-3 samples from `samples/` directory related to your topic
3. Apply patterns to generate authentic content
4. Validate against quality checklist (12+ checkboxes)
5. Write output to `output/` directory

### For Orchestrators

Invoke the ghostwriter agent:

```
Task: ghostwriter-kody
Input: {topic, use_case, audience, length}
Output: Authentic content file in output/ directory
```

The agent will autonomously:
- Read voice samples
- Apply voice patterns
- Generate content
- Validate authenticity
- Report results

### For Humans (Kody)

**Reviewing Generated Content**:
1. Check `output/` directory for new drafts
2. Review against authenticity checklist in `voice-analysis.md`
3. Edit for final polish (target: <3 edits needed)
4. Provide feedback on patterns to improve

**Updating the Knowledge Base**:
1. Add new writing samples to `samples/` as voice evolves
2. Update `voice-analysis.md` with new patterns discovered
3. Track feedback patterns to improve future generations

## Voice Analysis Summary

### The Essential Patterns (20% That Creates 80%)

1. **Action-First Pragmatism**: Concrete scenarios before theory
2. **Conversational Authority**: Casual + confident, vulnerable + credible
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Neologisms, metaphors, bridges

### Linguistic DNA

- **Sentence Rhythm**: Short declarative punches + longer explanatory passages
- **Vocabulary**: orchestrate, spawn, synthesize, agent, conductor architecture, demand-driven
- **Tone**: Confident (no hedging), conversational ("Let me tell you..."), optimistic
- **Metaphors**: Beatles, orchestra, conductor for multi-agent systems
- **Frameworks**: Memorable neologisms ("Prompt Transplantation", "Agent Storytelling")

### Content Structure

- **Opening**: Concrete scenario / Relatable question / Declarative statement
- **Framework**: Problem → Traditional → New Paradigm (with neologism)
- **Conclusion**: Open-ended invitation ("..."), not closed completion

## Writing Samples Index

### Blog Posts

**1. The Prompt Transplant** (`samples/prompt-transplant.md`)
- **Topic**: AI-powered inbox automation with Claude
- **Voice Elements**: Personal confession ("old me"), concrete numbers (12,625 emails), neologism ("Prompt Transplantation")
- **Use For**: Personal productivity + AI topics

**2. Agent Storytelling** (`samples/agent-storytelling.md`)
- **Topic**: Natural language interfaces for business workflows
- **Voice Elements**: Declarative opening, conductor metaphor, Demand-Driven Development framework
- **Use For**: Enterprise AI + agent orchestration topics

**3. The Orchestrated Intelligence** (`samples/multi-agent-systems.md`)
- **Topic**: Multi-agent systems architecture
- **Voice Elements**: Beatles metaphor, conversational questions, vision + practicality balance
- **Use For**: Multi-agent systems + technical architecture topics

---

## Quality Validation

Every generated piece must pass the **4-Category Checklist** (see `voice-analysis.md`):

1. **Structural Markers** (3+ required)
2. **Vocabulary Match** (4+ required)
3. **Tone Signals** (3+ required)
4. **Content Logic** (3+ required)

**Pass Threshold**: 12+ total checkboxes across all categories

**Authenticity Score**: 85%+ required for human review

## Use Cases Supported

### Primary (Highest Impact)
- ✅ Blog Posts (800-1500 words, technical depth + accessibility)
- ✅ LinkedIn/Social Posts (150-300 words, professional insights)
- ✅ Documentation (variable length, authoritative instruction)

### Secondary
- ✅ Manifestos/Vision Pieces (1000-2000 words, passionate advocacy)
- ✅ Email Content (brief, professional, action-oriented)
- ✅ Presentation Outlines (bullet-driven, framework-focused)

---

## Feedback Loop & Continuous Improvement

### After Each Ghostwriting Session

1. **Kody Reviews** generated content in `output/` directory
2. **Logs Edits** - note all changes made
3. **Extract Patterns** - identify common edit types
   - Vocabulary adjustments
   - Structure improvements
   - Tone calibrations
   - Missing elements
4. **Update Voice Profile** - add successful patterns to `voice-analysis.md`
5. **Version Control** - increment voice profile version
6. **Next Generation** - improved patterns applied to future content

### Version History

- **v1.0** (2025-11-21): Initial voice profile from ULTRATHINK 8-agent analysis
- **v1.1** (TBD): Updated after first 10 pieces reviewed
- **v2.0** (TBD): Major evolution after first month

### Success Metrics Tracking

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Authenticity Score (first draft) | 85%+ | TBD |
| Edits Needed Before Publish | <3 | TBD |
| Time Saved (vs writing from scratch) | 70-80% | TBD |
| Blind Test Pass Rate | 90%+ | TBD |

## Domain Boundaries

### Write About ✅
- AI agent orchestration, multi-agent systems
- Microsoft Copilot, Dynamics, enterprise AI integration
- Natural language interfaces, agent storytelling
- Demand-driven development
- Productivity automation with AI
- Technology-business bridging

### Avoid ❌
- Pure academic AI research
- Low-level code implementation details
- Generic productivity advice (unrelated to AI)
- Non-Microsoft enterprise tools
- Topics unrelated to AI/agents/enterprise systems

## Technical Integration

### Invoking the Ghostwriter Agent

From orchestrator context:

```
Task tool invocation:
- subagent_type: "ghostwriter-kody"
- prompt: "Write a blog post about [topic] for [audience], approximately [length] words"
- description: "Generate content in Kody's voice"

Agent will:
1. Read voice-analysis.md + relevant samples
2. Generate content applying patterns
3. Validate against checklist
4. Write to output/ directory
5. Report authenticity score + file path
```

### File Naming Convention

```
Blog posts: blog-[topic-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].md
Social posts: social-[topic-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].md
Documentation: docs-[topic-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].md
Manifestos: vision-[topic-slug]-[YYYYMMDD].md
```
